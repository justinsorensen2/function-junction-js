# Function Junction

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of types, functions, argument-handling, loops, and conditional statements

## Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/function-junction) to your own account.
2. Change into your projects directory:
3. Clone your repository: `git clone function-junction`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd function-junction`
5. Install the dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn` for short)
6. Open in your editor]
7. Start the test runner: `yarn test`
7. Open `src/functions.test.js` and work on functions until tests pass.
8. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
9. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.

## Explorer Mode

- All tests passing
- No linter warnings
- Turn in the homework using the URL to your repository on Github.
- *CAUTION* One of the tests is broken. Your job is to update the test to pass.

## Adventure Mode

- If you used "built-in" JavaScript methods like `String.reverse()` or `Array.max()` to solve these problems, try implementing them from scratch.
- Vice-versa: if you implemented your solutions from scratch, look in the documentation linked below to see if JavaScript has any built-in functions to help solve these problems.

## Additional Resources

Reference the documentation on MDN to find what kind of helpful functions might already be on `Array` and `String` in JavaScript.

- [Array Functions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
